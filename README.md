Design improvements:
- Power bank is now placed horizontally, batteries were moved on top of the power bank. Now the robot doesn't tip-over even when spinning at 100% speed; in addition, the weight is more evenly distributed so the robot is more likely to follow the path it's supposed to follow regardless of terrain. Unfortunately I can't screw the power bank to the chassis therefore it's all done using Velcro.
- Mounted the brackets for ultrasonic sensors.
- Added a smiley face.
